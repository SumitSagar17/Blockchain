 ## Using Metamask 
  
 1. Create metamask wallet using the metamask extension or app and save the wallet address 
  
 2. Connect to Goreli Test-network in settings 
  
 3. Mine GoreliETH using this link (https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/) 
  
 4. Claim 0.01 GoerliETH or more. 
  
 Your metamask account should look something like this after mining the GoreliETH
